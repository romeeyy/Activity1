Theme: 
Intramurals 2025 – Digital Trophy Design  

Artwork Title:  
Best BSCS Spirit  

Brief Description of Concept:

For this activity, I designed a digital trophy using Python Pillow.  
I wanted the trophy to look festive and meaningful, so I used a golden cup with handles, a wooden base, and a plaque showing the award title.  
To make it feel like a real intramurals celebration, I added stars, colorful confetti, and a bold title at the top: “Intramurals 2025 Champion.” 
The idea is to show the energy, unity, and spirit of BSCS students during the intramurals.  

What I Learned from this Activity:

I learned how to use Pillow not just for simple shapes, but to create a full artwork with details like shading, shadows, and text effects.  
It was fun to mix coding with creativity, and I also practiced adjusting positions and colors to get the design I imagined.  
This activity helped me see how programming can be more than technical—it can also be artistic and expressive.
